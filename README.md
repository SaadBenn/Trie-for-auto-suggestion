# Trie

Trie Data structure is used under the hood in almost every computer including smart phones. The keyboard that you get on your phone uses the same data structure, when you start typing a word and it starts showing you suggestions. This is the idea behind Trie data structure. Another good example is Google's ```Did you mean....?```

# Why Trie
Tries are very useful for certain situations. Here are some of the advantages:

* Looking up values typically have a better worst-case time complexity.
* Unlike a hash map, a Trie does not need to worry about key collisions.
* Doesn't utilize hashing to guarantee a unique path to elements.
* Trie structures can be alphabetically ordered by default.

The goal of this project is to mimic auto suggestion feature of keyboards using Trie data structure in Python.
